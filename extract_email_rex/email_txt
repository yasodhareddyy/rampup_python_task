John was planning a vacation to explore the beauty of the Himalayas.
He contacted his friend Sarah at sarah@example.com to get some travel tips.
Sarah recommended a local guide named Rajesh, whose email was rajesh@mountainadventures.in.
After exchanging a few emails, John decided to book his trip. While hiking, he met fellow
travelers and shared contact information. One of them was from Germany with an email address:
julia@example.de. They all had a fantastic adventure, and their email exchanges continued long after they returned home

Here are some email addresses:
surapareddy.yasodha@terralogic.com    valid.ex@gmail.com
